            <p style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-style: italic;">"Ariana is the one that got away. She loved me when I was nobody. She got my name tattooed in Japanese on her hand - that's real love. Not 'my boyfriend' on Saturday Night Live for ratings. When Mac died, I knew I had to let her go. She needed to heal, not deal with my mess. I still write her letters I'll never send."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The audience went SILENT. Someone yelled "Get her back!" and Pete just shook his head and took another shot.</p>
