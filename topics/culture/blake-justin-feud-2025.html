        <h2 style="color: #d4a574; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: Georgia, serif;">How It All Started Going DOWN</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Honey, when they filmed "It Ends With Us," nobody knew it would end with THEM! Sources say the tension on set was thicker than my grandma's gravy. Blake wanted creative control, Justin wanted director respect, and chile... neither was backing down!</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Then came the premiere in August 2024. Notice how they didn't take ONE photo together? Not one! My insider at Sony told me security had to keep them in separate areas. The tea was already brewing, but we had NO idea how hot it would get!</p>

        <h2 style="color: #d4a574; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The EXPLOSIVE Allegations</h2>
        
        <div style="background: rgba(244, 160, 196, 0.1); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <h3>üì∏ Blake's Complaint Says:</h3>
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Girl, the details are WILD! She claims Justin showed her nude videos of other women, talked about his "porn addiction" on set, and tried to add unnecessary intimate scenes. The complaint also says he came to her trailer uninvited while she was breastfeeding!</p>

        <div style="background: rgba(244, 160, 196, 0.1); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <h3>üí∏ Justin's $400M Response:</h3>
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">But WAIT! Justin came back swinging with a $400 MILLION lawsuit! He says Blake and Ryan tried to hijack HIS movie, that they're making up lies to steal the sequel rights, and get this - he has text messages that allegedly prove it was all a setup!</p>

        <h2 style="color: #d4a574; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Ryan Reynolds Plot Twist</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Now here's where it gets JUICY! Turns out Ryan wasn't just being a supportive husband. Sources say he literally rewrote scenes, showed up to meetings uninvited, and even confronted Justin in his own production office. One crew member told me: "It was like Deadpool walked onto our romantic drama set and nobody knew what to do!"</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The real tea? Ryan allegedly wrote the rooftop scene that made it into the final cut WITHOUT credited approval. Justin's team is calling it a "hostile takeover by Hollywood's power couple." I mean... the DRAMA!</p>

        <h2 style="color: #d4a574; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The LEAKED Text Messages!</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Y'all... when the New York Times dropped those text messages from Justin's PR team, I SCREAMED! They literally wrote about "burying" Blake and planning "social takedowns." One text said, and I quote: "We need to be ready with the narrative that she's difficult."</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">But here's the gag - Blake's team ALSO had receipts! They showed messages where they discussed "protecting Blake's image at all costs" and making Justin look like the villain. Both sides were playing DIRTY!</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-style: italic;">With a trial set for March 2026, this tea is going to keep brewing for YEARS! Will Blake get justice? Will Justin clear his name? Will Ryan ever work with Sony again? </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 1rem; color: #f4a0c4;">One thing's for sure - this drama is FAR from over! ü´ñ</p>
