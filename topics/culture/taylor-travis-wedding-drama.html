        <h2 style="color: #d4a574; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Prenup Tea That Nearly Ended It All</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">OKAY, so my source at Tree Paine's office (Taylor's publicist) told me the prenup negotiations were INSANE! Travis wanted a "cheating clause" that would give him $50 million if Taylor strayed. But here's the kicker - Taylor wanted the SAME clause to apply to him, and honey, his lawyers were NOT having it!</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The real drama? They couldn't agree on the "football wife" clause. Apparently, Taylor's team wanted it IN WRITING that she wouldn't have to attend more than 8 games per season. Travis's mom Donna almost called the whole thing off when she heard about it!</p>

        <h2 style="color: #d4a574; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Why Beyonc√© Said "Boy, Bye" üëë</h2>
        
        <div style="background: rgba(244, 160, 196, 0.1); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 1.1rem;">Y'all sitting down? Good. Because Beyonc√© turned down $2 MILLION to perform at the reception. The reason? She allegedly told friends that she "doesn't do weddings anymore after the Dubai situation." But insiders say the REAL tea is that she's Team Kim (Kardashian) after that whole Kanye mess, and performing at Taylor's wedding would be picking sides!</p>
            
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, serif; margin-top: 1rem;">Instead, they got... wait for it... Ed Sheeran, Sabrina Carpenter, AND Post Malone. But the GOOP? Olivia Rodrigo was supposedly invited to perform but "had other commitments." Girl, we all know what that means! üëÄ</p>

                    <li>‚Ä¢ Karlie Kloss (OUCH!)</li>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The BIGGEST shock? Sophie Turner was there as Joe Jonas's plus one, and apparently she and Taylor had a SECRET bathroom meeting that lasted 45 minutes. Security was posted outside and everything! My waiter source said they came out with puffy eyes... reconciliation or confrontation? The girls aren't telling!</p>

        <h2 style="color: #d4a574; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Dress Disasters</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Chile, let me tell you about these dresses! Taylor commissioned THREE custom gowns - one Versace, one Oscar de la Renta, and one Vivienne Westwood. The Versace arrived and it was GORGEOUS... until she tried it on and the whole back RIPPED! Donatella was on a private jet within hours with a team to fix it!</p>
        
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The second dress crisis? The Westwood gown was supposedly STOLEN from the delivery truck! They found it two days later being sold on Poshmark for $50K. The seller claimed they "found it" but honey, we all know that's cap!</p>

            <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; font-family: Georgia, serif; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>‚Ä¢ Patrick Mahomes gave a speech that made Travis CRY (it was about brotherhood ü•∫)</li>
                <li>‚Ä¢ Someone's plus-one tried to livestream and got EJECTED by security</li>
                <li>‚Ä¢ The cake collapsed during cutting (5 tiers, $50K DOWN)</li>
                <li>‚Ä¢ Ice Spice and Selena Gomez were seen arguing on the terrace</li>
                <li>‚Ä¢ Travis's ex, Kayla Nicole, somehow got in with fake credentials!</li>

        <h3 style="color: #d4a574; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">üíï But Here's the Sweet Tea...</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-style: italic;">Despite ALL the drama, sources say the ceremony was beautiful. Taylor walked down the aisle to a string quartet playing "Love Story," Travis couldn't stop smiling, and even Andrea (Taylor's mom) was seen hugging Donna Kelce.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 1rem; color: #f4a0c4;">Sometimes love really does win... even with a $50K cake disaster! ü´ñ</p>
